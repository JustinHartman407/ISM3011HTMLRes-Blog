	<h4 style="text-align:left; text-indent: 3em; line-height:2.0em; font-size:20px"> As the world we know today has evolved, we have come a long way from the 1940’s when Alan Turing created the very first primitive computer. Back then it was a massive machine that had one purpose; to crack the German Enigma code and win the war for the allies. Little did Turing know, that with this invention he would usher in an area of computer science that would change the lives of many. By the 1990’s a new revolution was under way and now the once limited personal computer was owned by 34% of the American population. Now computers are an everyday device, that have the ability to surf the web, compute problems, create music, edit photo’s, play games, and many other incredible features that make our lives easier. However, any rational person is always wondering what’s next beyond the abundance of advances we have seen? Those within the computer science field are always looking for ways to make the machine faster, smarter and as always better. In research labs across the world there is an invention that has the potential to shake up the world again within a few years. It is known as the Quantum computer and in 4-5 years it could be scarcely available. Quantum computers as we know them today are run at temperatures at slightly above absolute zero. They work this way because physics are pushed to the boundary and the quasiparticles emerge. Computers work in 1’s and 0’s otherwise knowns as binary. With a quantum computer they would be able to run at both 1 and 0 at the same time which has become to be known as super positioning. Giving way to faster computing speeds and new technology that we could have only dreamt of. This would give rise to a radical emergence in new artificial intelligence, new medicine research, new ways to boost the economy, and power any computations that are too large for standard computers today. That explains why companies such as IBM, Google, Microsoft, and Intel are all funding research and development into quantum computers, because they know the gravity of stable quantum computers in the hands of a business. According to the article, one of the biggest obstacles for quantum computers to overcome is that the basic quantum units (qubits) are very unstable. Even the slightest noise throws qubits off and causes an error. With the lab work of Leo Kouwenhoven creating thick specialized cables that won’t cause an error to the qubits, the researchers are getting closer and closer to solving the current problems with quantum computers. When they are finally completed, large numbers will be able to be factored and analyzed, leading to cracking of encryptions and the creation of even harder encryptions in their place. The advancements made in quantum computing could change the business profession forever. Companies collects countless amount of gigs of data, so let’s say sales revenue of a company has data that needs to be analyzed to make a tough business decision. This normally could take weeks to calculate but with quantum computing the results would almost be instantaneous. The demand for business analysts could take a dip but if there’s analysts that know how to work quantum computing and interrupt that data, then their use skyrockets. As someone who one day wants to own their own tech start-up, quantum computing can be a game changing for whatever product field I go into selling. Say I wanted to enter into the field of data analytics for a manufacturing firm. Calculating how much money needs to go into something to get something out and the logistics of shipping or producing will be made in seconds rather than in long drawn out processes. A countries Gross Domestic Product can even catch a boost with the power of quantum computing being the main force behind this. In something that seems like it is straight out of a movie, quantum computing could eventually revolutionize all of advertising to anyone. This could be done by developing a highly personalized advertising software that is tailored to individuals. Through sophisticated calculations and intense data mining, people will be targeted to buy the exact products they need and that fit their preference. This already happens today but in a way that probably looks rudimentary to what could be achievable in the nearby future. With the world seeming to flow into chaos over the last decade, maybe there is hope within new technology, just like in the past. Over a hundred years ago only half of American children went through education, women couldn’t vote, and minimum wage was a 25 cents an hour, and now we could be on the verge on technological renaissance. Quantum computing has the potential to affect every facet of life with many other unforeseen advances to come. </h4>
